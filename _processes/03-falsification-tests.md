title: Falsification Tests
summary: "Apply signed residual tests on BH/GW sets to challenge the hypothesis."
---
## Objective
Test whether the proposed ratio/correction explains external datasets.
## Steps
1. Build BH/GW CSVs with provenance.
2. Compute signed proxy residuals.
3. Assess significance; non-parametric stats.
4. Document fails & edge cases.
## Outputs
- `results/*.csv`, `figures/*.png`
- Short narrative with interpretation limits
